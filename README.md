# REQUIREMENT:

The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs for geospatial processing services. Clients can request the execution of processes and specify how the output from the process is handled. An assessment of required processes is necessary to determine how such services can be utilized in a military environment.


# INTEROPERABILITY BENEFITS:

Common understanding, interoperability and reusability of web processing services for the military community. A process profile is described by the WPS 2.0 standard as a process on an interface level. Process profiles may have different levels of abstraction and cover several aspects. On a generic level, a process profile may only refer to the provided functionality of a process, i.e. by giving a verbal or formal definition how the outputs are derived from the inputs. On a concrete level a process profile may completely define inputs and outputs including data type definitions and formats.
