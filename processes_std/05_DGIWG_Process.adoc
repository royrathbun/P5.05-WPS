=== General

While this document definitions and requirements may be used by any geoprocessing implementation, OGC WPS 2.0 specification (<<OGC-WPS-2.0>>) provides a mechanism to define common processing functionality. Aiming at harmonization, the definitions of process profiles may be used to foster a common understanding of widely used processing functions. However, they may also be used to harmonize the technical details of process interfaces and thus document particular interoperability arrangements between process providers and consumers.

A process profile is a description of a process on an interface level. Process profiles may have different levels of abstraction and cover several aspects. On a generic level, a process profile may only refer to the provided functionality of a process, i.e. by giving a verbal or formal definition how the outputs are derived from the inputs. On a concrete level a process profile may completely define inputs and outputs including data type definitions and formats. This document specifies requirement to develop process profiles at a generic level.

Figure below provides an UML description of the generic process model.
