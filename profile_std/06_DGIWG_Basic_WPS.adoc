=== General

WARNING: structure of requirement (DGIWG current style vs new OGC style), to be discussed in MANAGEMENT Team

*_Requirement {counter:dgiwg_basic_req}: a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall implement the "Basic WPS service profile" conformance class (http://www.opengis.net/spec/WPS/2.0/conf/service/profile/basic-wps) from <<OGC-WPS-2.0>>._*

"_Basic WPS service profile conformance class comprises the synchronous and asynchronous execution protocol, the WPS process model, and implements HTTP/POST+XML and HTTP/GET+KVP encodings._" (source <<OGC-WPS-2.0>>)

NOTE: To clarify previous sentence, it requires to support synchronous or/and asynchronous conformance class(es).
Synchronous requires support of GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess and Execute operations.
Asynchronous requires suport of GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, GetStatus and GetResult operations.
For each of these operation, at least one binding has to be supported (HTTP/GET+KVP or  HTTP/POST+XML).

==== GetCapabilities operation

Following figure illustrates different parts of the GetCapabilities response document.

*_Requirement {counter:dgiwg_basic_req}: a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall provide elements in the GetCapabilities response document as described in tables <<get_cap_serviceID>>, <<get_cap_serviceProvider>>, <<get_cap_OperationsMetadata>>, <<get_cap_Language>> and <<process_sum>>._*

*_Requirement {counter:dgiwg_basic_req}: a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall provide lang element for all content of type LanguageString._*

*_Requirement {counter:dgiwg_basic_req}: a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall provide metadata content in a response to a "GetCapabilities" request in English language. For each element of type LanguageString, it does require for element lang to be "en-GB"._*

*_Requirement {counter:dgiwg_basic_req}: If content provided by a WFS server is classified, a DGIWG Basic WPS server shall identify the highest classification level of the content accessible through the WFS service by populating the accessConstraints element._*

*_Requirement {counter:dgiwg_basic_req}: A WPS server shall support service exceptions in English language._*

NOTE: for example _title_, _abstract_ and _keywords_ elements are of type LanguageString which comprise a value (CharacterString) and an optional lang element (from RFC 4646). They have to be provided at least in english (with lang being en-GB) and optionalty in other languages (with lang fr-CA for french (Canada)).

NOTE: The contents of the CI_ResponsibleParty class are modified to omit the optional organizationName attribute in CI_ContactInfo, since the ProviderName contains this information. The mandatory ―role― attribute in the CI_ResponsibleParty class is made optional, since no clear use of this information is known in the ServiceProvider section. Since all contents of the ServiceContact are now optional, the ServiceContact is now made optional.
